### Updated List of Missing Important Words

Based on your current implementation, here is the revised list of the most important common FORTH words that are still missing, excluding those already defined in `initialize`:

1. **Control Flow Words**:
   - `if...else...then`: Conditional execution.
   - `begin...until`: Loop with a condition at the end.
   - `begin...again`: Infinite loop.
   - `do...loop`: Counted loop.

2. **Stack Manipulation**:
   - `roll`: Roll the stack items.

3. **Memory and Variables**:
   - `variable`: Define a variable.
   - `constant`: Define a constant.

4. **Defining Words**:
   - `does>`: Define behavior for a word.

### Control Flow Words

1. **if...else...then**:
   - `if` ( n -- ): If n is non-zero, execute the following words until `else` or `then`.
   - `else`: Used with `if` to specify an alternate execution path.
   - `then`: Marks the end of the `if` structure.

2. **begin...until**:
   - `begin`: Marks the beginning of a loop.
   - `until` ( n -- ): Ends the loop if n is non-zero.

3. **begin...again**:
   - `begin`: Marks the beginning of a loop.
   - `again`: Unconditionally loops back to `begin`.

4. **do...loop**:
   - `do` ( n1 n2 -- ): Starts a counted loop, with the loop index starting at n1 and ending at n2.
   - `loop`: Ends the loop and increments the loop index.

### Stack Manipulation

1. **roll**:
   - `roll` ( ... n -- ... ): Rotates the nth item to the top of the stack.

### Memory and Variables

1. **variable**:
   - `variable` ( -- ): Defines a variable.

2. **constant**:
   - `constant` ( n -- ): Defines a constant with the value n.

### Defining Words

1. **does>**:
   - `does>`: Used to define the behavior of a new word.

These words are crucial for a more complete and functional FORTH interpreter.

### Updated List of Missing Important Words

1. **Stack Manipulation**:
   - `roll`: Roll the stack items.

2. **Memory and Variables**:
   - `variable`: Define a variable.
   - `constant`: Define a constant.

3. **Defining Words**:
   - `does>`: Define behavior for a word.

### Stack Manipulation

1. **roll**:
   - `roll` ( ... n -- ... ): Rotates the nth item to the top of the stack.

### Memory and Variables

1. **variable**:
   - `variable` ( -- ): Defines a variable.

2. **constant**:
   - `constant` ( n -- ): Defines a constant with the value n.

### Defining Words

1. **does>**:
   - `does>`: Used to define the behavior of a new word.

These words are crucial for a more complete and functional FORTH interpreter.
